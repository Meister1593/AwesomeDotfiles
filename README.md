# AwesomeDotfiles
My dotfiles that i use daily because no other WM or DE provides such experience 
Most of the awesomewm dotfiles are based on https://github.com/WillPower3309/awesome-dotfiles dotfiles, which i'm glad he did them like so.

I didn't like how keys were placed and it lacked some programs i needed, so i modified it a bit, added several keys, added rules for my go-to programs and games to place on certain workspaces

TODO:
  1. Move away from Breeze-Dark theme
  2. Submodule rofi theme to proper git repository
  3. Add proper list of dependencies (it is quite big) and remove all unnecessary stuff that isn't needed (mirage theme?)
  4. Started typescript-to-lua transisiton (calendar) should be either completed, or reverted back to normal Lua
